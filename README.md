## Cole's Website

This is the repo for my current website portfolio, which is currently in development.

How I started my React project

```npx create-react-app "Project-Name"```

```npm audit```

Currently, I have installed the following packages...

- emailjs
- fontawesome
- animate.css
- gsap-trial
- loaders.css
- react-leaflet
- react-loaders
- react-router-dom
- sass

all these packages can be installed using the following command...

```npm i "Package-Name"```

Most of what I have learned thus far and will continue to learn from is from this Youtube video by **freeCodeCamp.org**, link below
